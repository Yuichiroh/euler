/** Arranged probability
  * Problem 100
  *
  * If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue discs and six red discs,
  * and two discs were taken at random, it can be seen that the probability of taking two blue discs, P(BB) = (15/21)Ã—(14/20) = 1/2.
  *
  * The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking two blue discs at random,
  * is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and thirty-five red discs.
  *
  * By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000 discs in total,
  * determine the number of blue discs that the box would contain.
